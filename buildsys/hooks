# This is empty for now; it will be filled in as functions are built

# hooks jumps from the code to your code, overwriting 8-10 bytes of code to do so.  an example:
#
#   0002 AddWildPartyPokemon_hook 080029E0 5
#
# this opens up overlay 2, jumps to file offset 0x29E0, and assembles this at that offset:
#
#   ldr r5, =AddWildPartyPokemon_hook|1 // (|1 only if in thumb mode)
#   bx r5
#   .pool
#
# you can link directly to c code if there is a free register to do so.  the standard for arm
# assembly specifies that r0-r3 are arguments to a function and are not preserved across function
# calls, so if your function has less than 4 arguments, you can use r3 as a hook register and
# replace the entire thing
# 
# otherwise you have to link to a "hook" to the c code where you write custom assembly to make
# the game feel okay about what it's doing

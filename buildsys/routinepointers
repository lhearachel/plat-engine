# This is empty for now; it will be filled in as functions are built

# routinepointers will write a pointer to the function at the offset specified:
#
#    0012 Task_DistributeExp_Extend 0223E858
#
# this opens up overlay 12, jumps to the offset that would be in memory at 0223E858,
# and writes a pointer to Task_DistributeExp_Extend there. if the function is thumb,
# it automatically add's +1 to the offset
